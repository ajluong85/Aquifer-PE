My role as a software engineer was to create a survey renderer so that user user could fill out a survey and submit the answers to the database. On the backend I wrote SQL store procedure to get the data for the survey, in the middle tier in dotnet I wrote the RESTful APIs to GET, and POST for the surveys that were taken. On the frontend I rendered the surveys based on the question types and answer choices. This dynamic rendering was the most challenging part of the project because it involved forms and dynamically rendering different objects on the form. Below is a list of the actions I took to accomplish my feature:

-Implemented and designed dynamic surveys in React for users incorporated Formik with Yup
schema validation.
-Built complex components in React to render survey form data based on different question
and answer types.
-Implemented dynamic validation based on different surveys created by survey creator.
-Utilized ASP.NET MVC to build models in C# designing model routing, model validation, and
dependency injection to validate data during my work on this web application.
-Created controllers in ASP.NET to pass data to our View in React.js utilizing JavaScript,
Bootstrap, CSS, and basic HTML5.
-Designed and maintained relational databases, stored procedures and user defined tables
using MS SQL Server Management Studio while managing database resources to ensure
satisfaction of unique data requirements and preventing duplicate data.
-Responsible for building API endpoints with ASP.NET core and tests with Postman REST client
that allowed clients to read and write to the database as required.
-Enthusiastically engaged with my development team throughout the Software Development
-Life Cycle utilizing peer planning sessions, code reviews, virtual pair programming, source
control process, Sr Dev-Jr Dev interactions, and peer-peer testing.
-Incorporated client-side and server-side validation functionality via the .NET stack.
-Established application with a team in AGILE environment, regularly using source-control (Git
and GitHub) and participated in daily scrum meetings, peer code reviews and team code
talks to ensure code quality and continuity.
